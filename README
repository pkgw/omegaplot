OmegaPlot
=========

OmegaPlot is a Python library for creating excellent plots. It offers:

* Drop-dead easy support for standard plotting needs with attractive
  results.
* Output of those plots to the screen, PDF, EPS, and PNG with
  optimal quality and identical rendering for each.
* Support for better-than-publication-quality, professional-level
  features such as full vectorized rendering of arbitrary equations,
  angled axis ticks on spherical projections, etc.

Here are a few of the key technical features that allow these goals
to be accomplished:

* A clean, modular, object-oriented API for creating and combining plots,
  with good separation between plot structure and styling.
* Rendering with the Cairo toolkit to allow fully vectorized drawing
  of plots to multiple backends with ideal bitmapping and performance
  and no code changes.
* Optional support for text rendering through LaTeX, with full
  vectorization of the output, and Pango, with simple high-quality
  typesetting and textual information embedded in PDF output.
* Default styling that aims to be both attractive and legible, following
  a Tuftean design aesthetic.

OmegaPlot has been written by Peter Williams, peter@newton.cx. It has
been stable and useful for his purposes, but it is currently a
homebrew project: there is no manual, examples are rare, and the API
has its share of hacks and rough edges.

On the other hand, you can get personal support from Peter for just
about any question via email. If you're at all interested, please
