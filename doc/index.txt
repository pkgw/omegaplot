OmegaPlot Tutorial and Reference
================================

|omega| is a framework for creating plots using the `Python
<http://www.python.org/>`_ programming language. It aspires to the
following key goals:

* Producing attractive, accessible, publication-quality output. 
* Presenting a clean, usable API to users.

The rendering backend of OmegaPlot is the `Cairo
<http://www.cairographics.org/>`_ graphics library, via the
`PyCairo <http://www.cairographics.org/pycairo/>`_ bindings. OmegaPlot 
stores and accesses data using the `NumPy <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_
package.

Features currently supported by OmegaPlot include:

* Interactive plotting with rendering via the `GTK+
  <http://www.gtk.org/>`_ toolkit. Special integration with the 
  `IPython <http://ipython.scipy.org/>`_ interactive shell is included.
* Paginated output to PostScript, PDF, SVG, and PNG files. Generally, any output
  target supported by Cairo can easily be used by OmegaPlot.
* Sophisticated rectangular (X, Y) plots.
* Arbitrary layout of multiple plots in grids, stacks, and so on.

This documentation describes OmegaPlot version |version|, implementing
version |release| of the API. It was generated on |today|. 
The documentation is created using `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_.
