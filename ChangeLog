2007-01-29  Peter Williams  <peter@newton.cx>

	* omega/base.py (Painter.setParent): New function. We need parenting
	so that adding a Painter into two different containers works correctly.
	(Painter.configurePainting): Refuse to configure unless we have a parent.
	(NullPainter.doPaint): Apply a genericLine linestyle so that we actually
	paint something in the correct style.
	(Overlay): Manage children.
	(Overlay.removeChild): Rename from removePainter to conform to new model.
	(Grid): Same.

	* omega/sources.py (ParametricFunction): New class, like the Function source
	but the function yields (x,y) pairs, not just y values.
	(LinearIterator): Utility class.
	
	* omega/gtkUtil.py (OmegaArea.setPainter): Set the painter's parent to
	self so that it configures
	(OmegaArea.removeChild): Noop function to make self._painter happy. Should
	probably be implemented to clear the painter so that directly calling it
	makes sense.

2007-01-24  Peter Williams  <peter@newton.cx>

	* omega/base.py (StreamSink.expose): New utility, calls bag.exposeSink.
	(RectPlot.doPaint): Clip field painters to paint on the field. This
	might be worth making optional.
	(RectDataPainter.lineStyle): Add this style prop; apply it before
	painting field lines. Still need to make line drawing disable-able...
	Also, this property should default to some 'nth data set' style thing.

	* omega/sources.py (Function.pointiter.__init__): Add a float() in case
	the dumbass user (perhaps, for example, me) sets xmax and xmin to ints.

	* omega/styles.py (TestStyle.initContext): Add a function to be called
	before any painting is performed. Here, paints the background white.
	(TestStyle.apply_genericLine): Implement this to set the width to 1
	and color to black.

	* omega/gtkUtil.py (OmegaArea._expose): Call omegaStyle.initContext before
	painting.

	* demo/sinc.py: New demo, draws sinc * sin and sinc * cos. Requires
	numpy.

2007-01-21  Peter Williams  <peter@newton.cx>

	* omega/gtkUtil.py (OmegaDemoWindow): Copy the OmegaArea functions
	for convenience.
	(LiveDisplay): Renamed from GtkOmegaDemo, better name. Also copy
	the OmegaArea functions and reorganize __init__.

	* omega/__init__.py: Reorder imports to alphabetical and import
	LiveDisplay from gtkUtil.

	* Makefile.am: Hey, forgot to svn add the new one.

	* omega: Move files into here, so 'import omega' from the toplevel
	works if PYTHONPATH includes '.'. 

	* demo/Makefile.am: Add this too.
	
	* Makefile.am, configure.ac: Tweaks for the above.
	
2007-01-21  Peter Williams  <peter@newton.cx>

	* bag.py (Bag.linkTo): Add basic 'linking' support, which allows
	making one sink feed into another. Going to be used for processing
	the incoming data streams. Also work a bit on what is an iter and
	what is a list, because you can only iterate over an iter once.

	* base.py (RectDataPainter.doChunkPaint): Fix obsolete references
	to self.pointStamp.
	(StreamSink.linkTo): Add this method.
	(Painter): fix init of mainStyle, duh.

2007-01-21  Peter Williams  <peter@newton.cx>

	* styles.py: Move TestStyle here; new file for holding
	various style classes.

	* bag.py: Move Bag here, new file.

	* sources.py: Move FuncSource here as Function; new file
	for holding various data source classes.

	* base.py: Above classes moved from here.

2007-01-20  Peter Williams  <peter@newton.cx>

	* stamps.py: New file, contains a bunch of generic
	stamps (formerly PointPainters). 

	* demo/stampDemo.py: New file, demos the stamps.

	* gtkUtil.py: New file, put the Gtk widgets and
	GtkOmegaDemo here.

	* Project import.
