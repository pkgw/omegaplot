	* omega: Move files into here, so 'import omega' from the toplevel
	works if PYTHONPATH includes '.'.

	* bag.py (Bag.linkTo): Add basic 'linking' support, which allows
	making one sink feed into another. Going to be used for processing
	the incoming data streams. Also work a bit on what is an iter and
	what is a list, because you can only iterate over an iter once.

	* base.py (RectDataPainter.doChunkPaint): Fix obsolete references
	to self.pointStamp.
	(StreamSink.linkTo): Add this method.
	(Painter): fix init of mainStyle, duh.
